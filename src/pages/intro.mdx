            Hi! I'm Romit Mohane, a B.Tech. student in Artificial Intelligence at <a target="_blank" href="https://iitgn.ac.in/">IIT Gandhinagar</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ever since I learned about Java in my CS classes during high school, I've been passionate about building software: from desktop, mobile and web applications to digital hardware systems. Lately, I've been exploring cutting-edge areas like <em>Generative AI and 3D Computer Vision</em> as part of the <em>Computer Vision, Imaging, and Graphics (CVIG) Lab</em> and also <em>Neuromorphic Computing</em> in the <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/iitgn.ac.in/edrl/home">Emerging Devices & Systems Lab (EDSL)</a>. What drives me most is interdisciplinary application of technology and helping others build along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of research and development, I enjoy sharpening my Data Structures and Algorithms skills, taking on freelance projects on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fiverr.com/s/1qoXRGk">Fiverr</a>, playing games, watching sci-fi, and hitting the gym.
